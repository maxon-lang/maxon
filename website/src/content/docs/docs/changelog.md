description: Every released version of the Maxon compiler and standard library, and what changed in it.
---

Every released version, newest first.

Downloads for each release are on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/maxon-lang/maxon/releases), and the install instructions are in
[Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation/).

## 0.2.1 — 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- The compiler occasionally crashed partway through a build with `Range check failed: value outside
  typealias 'AllocCount'`.
- A green thread that started reading a socket while another was finishing a read of the same socket
  could wait forever, unreported by the deadlock detector. It now stops with the documented error for
  two readers on one socket, every time.
- On Windows, a socket receive or send that had already completed when its deadline passed or the
  socket closed reported a timeout: the bytes received were lost, and a retried send went out twice.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-14

### Added

- One-line installers for macOS, Linux and Windows, which install the latest release into
  `~/.maxon`.
- `maxon upgrade`, which updates the install the running compiler belongs to.
- Container images at `ghcr.io/maxon-lang/maxon`, in `debian` and `distroless` variants for amd64
  and arm64.
- The Homebrew formula serves x64 and arm64 Linux as well as macOS.
- `maxon mcp-server`, a Model Context Protocol server exposing build, run, test, format, check, IR
  dumps and error-code lookup to AI tools.

### Changed

- A green thread that runs for 10 ms without waiting is preempted, including inside a loop that
  calls nothing, so one busy thread no longer holds up the others.
- Socket reads, accepting a connection, subprocess pipes and waiting for a child process park only
  the green thread that waits; none of them occupies an OS thread any more.
- `main` runs as a green thread whose stack grows as needed, and idle green threads give back stack
  they no longer use.
- Mutating a value that a live `let` can still observe is refused, however the value was reached —
  through a call's result, a closure, an interface method or a union payload as well as a direct
  field. A write through a method or a field that could reach such a record is a new error, E3159.
- Generated code is substantially faster: every function called from one place is inlined, and the
  optimizer gains value-range analysis, bounds-check elimination against loop limits, loop
  unswitching, jump threading and hot/cold code layout. `fannkuch-redux` runs in about 1.2× the time
  of the C reference, down from 5.4×.
- A stack trace names inlined functions as their own frames, and prints up to 100 frames, saying
  when it stops short.
- The compiler runs its per-function optimization passes and instruction selection in parallel.
- On Windows, a compiled program's file description is its own name; the "Built with Maxon" credit
  is in its Comments field.

### Fixed

- `maxon build` intermittently hung on macOS when a build manifest ran subprocesses.
- Deep recursion in `main` overflowed its stack at 1 MB on Windows.
- A function returning a tuple of two records could hand back a freed record.
- Passing a struct that holds a file or socket to an `async` call crashed the compiler.
- A fault on arm64 macOS with a corrupted stack hung instead of printing a trace, and a fault on a
  Windows green thread printed its report twice.
- `maxon run` failed in deeply nested directories on Windows.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-10

### Added

- `maxon run`, which compiles a program and runs it in one step. A `.maxon` file may begin with a
  `#!` line and be run directly as a script.
- `maxon help`, and `maxon help <command>` for a single command. Running `maxon` with no arguments
  now lists the commands.
- `--define`, which sets a top-level `String` constant at build time.
- Build manifests can declare several named targets, and state the version of what they build.
- Compiled executables carry version metadata: a version resource on Windows, a source version on
  macOS, and a producer string on Linux.

### Changed

- `maxon version` replaces the `--version` and `-V` flags, and reports the commit and date the
  compiler was built from.
- `maxon help` replaces the `--help` and `-h` flags.
- `Build.buildOne` in a build manifest is renamed `Build.build`.
- `maxon fmt` separates groups of declarations with one blank line at every nesting depth, not only
  at the top level.
- On Linux and macOS, starting a program that cannot be found raises
  `SubprocessError.executableNotFound` instead of `spawnFailed`.

### Fixed

- Non-ASCII text displays correctly in a Windows console.
- A deadlocked program on Linux reports the deadlock instead of occasionally hanging.
- A default parameter value is filled in a global variable's initializer, not only inside a function.
- On Linux, a subprocess started by program name finds the program on `PATH`, and a file of that
  name in the working directory is never run in its place.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-08

The first release. One compiler, written in Maxon, that builds itself.

### Added

- Binaries for `x64-windows`, `x64-linux`, `arm64-macos` and `arm64-linux`, each built and tested
  on its own architecture.
- A Homebrew formula for macOS.
- A VS Code extension, on the Marketplace and Open VSX, with a language server providing
  diagnostics, hover, go-to-definition, completion, rename, symbols and formatting.
- `maxon build`, `fmt`, `test`, `spec-test` and `lsp-server`, and a build manifest written as a
  Maxon program rather than a configuration file.
