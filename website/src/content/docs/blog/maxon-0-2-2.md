**Maxon 0.2.2 is released.** Archives for every supported target are on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/maxon-lang/maxon/releases/tag/v0.2.2).

## What changed

### Added

- `MAXON_PREEMPT=off`, which stops the scheduler taking a processor back from the green thread
  holding it, for a program whose result depends on a thread running uninterrupted. Unset or `on`
  preempts as before; any other value stops the program before `main` runs.

### Changed

- `maxon build`, and `maxon` with no arguments, open with the version line and a warning that Maxon
  is an early preview whose language, standard library and tools may change incompatibly between
  releases.
- A build reports how long the compile took, and no longer prints a line naming the executable
  format it wrote.
- The one-line installers make `maxon` work in the terminal that ran them rather than only in the
  next one. On macOS and Linux, an install whose `PATH` already holds a writable `~/.local/bin` or
  `~/bin` links the compiler there and edits no shell profile.

### Fixed

- A `StreamingSubprocess` handle kept after its child was released could drive the next child the
  runtime started in the same slot — waiting on it, reading its output, writing to its input. A
  copied `StreamingSubprocess` value reached this on its own, because each copy tracked release
  separately. A released handle is refused now.
- The sixty-fifth `runDetached` in a program's life failed, because a detached child never gave its
  runtime slot back.
- Releasing a `StreamingSubprocess` while another green thread collected it left the collector
  reading a slot holding no child, and could corrupt the poll records of unrelated sockets and
  pipes. Two green threads collecting one handle stopped with the error for two readers on one
  socket. Each of the three is a named stop of its own now.
- A socket closed and reopened while an operation was parked on it could take the previous socket's
  timeout, or wake a green thread that no longer owned it.
- Connecting to, or binding, an address written as a dotted quad parked the green thread for a name
  resolution that never ran.
- On Windows, a socket send or receive cancelled by its deadline after the kernel had already moved
  part of the buffer reported a timeout and no count, so a retried send went out twice and received
  bytes were consumed unseen. It reports what it moved, and the deadline is reported by the next
  call.
- On Windows, opening, connecting to and closing a socket counted as blocking kernel calls, so the
  scheduler could take a processor back during them, and Winsock was started up again on every
  connect.
- `Environment.inheritUpdating` and `Environment.custom` take an `EnvMap`, which the standard
  library did not export, so no caller could build the argument. It is public.
- A compiler rebuilding itself moved the running binary aside before compiling, so a compile error
  left the tree with no compiler to build the fix — and the move failed outright when another
  process, such as a language server, still ran the previous binary. The move happens only once the
  compile has succeeded, and a previous binary still in use is retired aside rather than deleted.
