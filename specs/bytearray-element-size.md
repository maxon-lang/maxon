# ByteArray Element Size and Byte-Slice Correctness

## Documentation

An `Array with Byte` (`ByteArray`) built via `ByteArray.create()` + `push`
must have its backing `__ManagedMemory` `element_size = 1`. The per-create
field-init stamp used to hardcode `element_size = 8` (correct only for the
pointer-width elements — int / float / string / struct — that dominate the
compiler's own containers). For a `Byte` element that stride is wrong: every
`push` writes 8 bytes apart, so `String.from(out)` reads only every 8th byte
and the reconstructed string is garbled.

This never surfaced under the C# bootstrap (which sizes the record per element
type) nor in most self-hosted spec tests (which round-trip strings through
stdlib helpers), so it only bit a *self-compiled* compiler: the type-resolver's
`byteSliceToString` (`ByteArray.create()` + per-byte `push`) is how a bare
`Union.caseName` read is split into `(unionName, caseName)`. A garbled slice
made every payload-free boxed-union case read (e.g. `Environment.inherit` as a
struct-literal field initializer) fail to resolve — a spurious "unknown enum
case" (E3034). The two behaviours below pin the root cause (byte-slice
reconstruction) and the shape that exposed it (a bare union case as a
struct-literal field init).

The array-*literal* twin of this hazard (`[a, b, c]`, `ByteArray from [...]`
built from non-constant narrow elements) is covered separately in
`array-literal-element-size.md` — the self-hosted compiler corrects it in a
post-TypeResolution pass, a capability the C# bootstrap's parse-time value-kind
front-end lacks, so that test is `status: selfhosted`.

## Tests

<!-- test: bytearray-slice-roundtrip -->
### Byte-by-byte slice reconstructs the correct substring
Pushes a `[start, end)` byte slice of a source string into a fresh `ByteArray`
one byte at a time, then rebuilds a `String`. With a wrong 8-byte stride the
reconstruction is garbage and the equality check fails.
```maxon
function main() returns ExitCode
	let src = "Environment.inherit"
	let bytes = src.toByteArray()
	var out = ByteArray.create()
	var i = 12
	while i < bytes.count() 'copy'
		let b = try bytes.get(i) otherwise 0
		out.push(b)
		i = i + 1
	end 'copy'
	let sliced = String.from(out)
	return 0 if sliced == "inherit" else 1
end 'main'
```
```exitcode
0
```

<!-- test: bytearray-slice-length -->
### Reconstructed byte-slice has the correct length and content
Rebuilds the whole source string byte-by-byte and returns its byte length. A
wrong stride would still push `count` bytes but pack them 8 apart, leaving a
`String` whose bytes decode to a different length than the original.
```maxon
function main() returns ExitCode
	let src = "hello world"
	let bytes = src.toByteArray()
	var out = ByteArray.create()
	for b in bytes 'copy'
		out.push(b)
	end 'copy'
	let rebuilt = String.from(out)
	return 0 if rebuilt == "hello world" else 1
end 'main'
```
```exitcode
0
```

<!-- test: bare-union-case-as-struct-field-init -->
### Bare payload-free boxed-union case read as a struct-literal field initializer
Mirrors `stdlib/Subprocess.maxon`'s `Configuration.create`: a boxed
(payload-bearing) union's payload-free case is read bare (`Env.inherit`) as a
struct-literal field initializer. Resolving that read runs the compiler's
byte-slice path; a mis-sized `ByteArray` there makes it spuriously unresolvable.
```maxon
union Env
	inherit
	set(vars StringArray)
end 'Env'

union In
	none
	bytes(data String)
end 'In'

type Cfg
	export var env as Env
	export var input as In

	export static function create() returns Cfg
		return Cfg{env: Env.inherit, input: In.none}
	end 'create'
end 'Cfg'

function main() returns ExitCode
	let c = Cfg.create()
	let e = match c.env 'e'
		inherit gives 0
		set(v) gives v.count()
	end 'e'
	let i = match c.input 'i'
		none gives 0
		bytes(d) gives d.byteLength()
	end 'i'
	return e + i
end 'main'
```
```exitcode
0
```
